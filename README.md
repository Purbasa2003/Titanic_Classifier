# Titanic_Survival_Classifier

Project Overview:

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python. The goal is to create a reliable model that can accurately predict whether a given passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics and circumstances.

Data and Methodology:

The project utilizes the well-known Titanic dataset from kaggle, which contains information about the passengers, such as their age, sex, class, etc and whether they survived the sinking of the Titanic. The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, and explored to gain insights into the factors that may have influenced the passengers' survival.

Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods, are implemented and compared to determine the most effective approach for this classification task. Techniques such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation are employed to optimize the model's performance.

Key Features:

Exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing
Implementation of multiple classification models
Comparison and evaluation of model performance
Feature importance analysis to understand the key factors affecting survival

Results:

The project report includes detailed information about the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall. The report also discusses the factors that had the greatest impact on passenger survival, as determined by feature importance analysis.
